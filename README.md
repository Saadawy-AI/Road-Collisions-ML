Road Collisions Prediction Project 🚦

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road collision data and building a machine learning model to predict accident-related outcomes.
The goal is to extract insights from the data, understand key factors behind road accidents, and evaluate the performance of predictive models.

Dataset

Type: Road Collisions Dataset

Format: CSV

Description: The dataset contains information such as dates, locations, road conditions, and other factors related to traffic accidents.
